# JavaScript Practice

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to practicing and mastering JavaScript through hands-on coding exercises, projects, and real-world examples. JavaScript is a powerful programming language used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. Practicing JavaScript regularly helps in improving problem-solving skills and understanding core programming concepts.

## Topics Covered
- **Basic Concepts**: Variables, data types, operators, and control structures (`if-else`, loops).
- **Functions & Scope**: Function declarations, arrow functions, closures, and scope management.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting, modifying, and dynamically updating HTML elements.
- **Event Handling**: Handling user interactions like clicks, keypresses, and form submissions.
- **ES6 Features**: Let/const, template literals, destructuring, modules, and async/await.
- **API & JSON Handling**: Fetching and processing data from external APIs.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Understanding promises, callbacks, and async/await.
- **Project Development**: Small projects like to-do apps, calculators, and interactive forms.
